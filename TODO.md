# To-Do

* Forces = Noise
* Forces = Circular Angle as direction
* Fix the seg fault on exit
* Fix the crash on add objs

Next: 

* [ ] -> Force Update Program Impl.
* [ ] -> Force Buffer represents a x by x grid.
    - [ ] -> Convert particle pos to grid coords.
    - [ ] -> Apply force, from a n radius sample, with distance calculated.
* [ ] -> Take a look at camera zoom in / out - Can I fix the bug?
* [ ] -> Emitter
    - [ ] -> Active / Inactive
    - [ ] -> 3D or 2D?
    - [ ] -> Change Interval?
* [ ] -> Noise In Shader

* [ ] -> Particle
* [ ] -> Wind
* [ ] -> Vortex
* [ ] -> Particle Cache

    
    
    

# Profile:

* Naive: Put into Buffer Directly
* 2D vs 3D
