# To-Do

# Priority:

* [ ] -> Culling / Bounds Checking
* [ ] -> Forces Class (Drag & Gravity)
* [ ] -> Impl. Second noise grid in shaders (add 3rd?)

Next: 

* [ ] -> Pause, Step Through

* Forces = Noise
* Forces = Circular Angle as direction
* Fix the seg fault on exit

* Tiling Grids, Multiple Updates.
* Particles Switch Grids As They Travel

* [ ] -> Emitter
    - [ ] -> Active / Inactive
    - [ ] -> 3D or 2D?
    - [ ] -> Change Interval?
* [ ] -> Noise In Shader

* [ ] -> Particle
* [ ] -> Wind
* [ ] -> Vortex
* [ ] -> Particle Cache

# Possible

* UUID for each system?
