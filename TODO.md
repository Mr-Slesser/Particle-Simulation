# To-Do

# Priority:

* [ ] -> Direction as a 2D vector
* [ ] -> Impl. Perlin Noise
* [ ] -> Culling / Bounds Checking
* [ ] -> Multithreading

* [ ] -> Profile Singlethreaded the Multithreaded!
* [ ] -> Why no spawn unless press q?

Next: 

* Forces = Noise
* Forces = Circular Angle as direction
* Fix the seg fault on exit

* Tiling Grids, Multiple Updates.
* Particles Switch Grids As They Travel

* [ ] -> Emitter
    - [ ] -> Active / Inactive
    - [ ] -> 3D or 2D?
    - [ ] -> Change Interval?
* [ ] -> Noise In Shader

* [ ] -> Particle
* [ ] -> Wind
* [ ] -> Vortex
* [ ] -> Particle Cache

# Profile:

* Naive: Put into Buffer Directly
* 2D vs 3D

# Possible

* UUID for each system?
